# VerizonVideoPartnerSDK Video Renderer

Purpose of this repo is to allow third-parties build their own renderer - this repo has an examples of our 2 base renderers.

## Inside

2 video renderers that we are using in **VerizonVideoPartnerSDK**.

1. Flat video renderer.
3. 360 video renderer.

**NOTE:** Both of them are registered on our backend micro-service. 
This means that your renderer also have to be registered to become valid for VerizonVideoPartnerSDK.
